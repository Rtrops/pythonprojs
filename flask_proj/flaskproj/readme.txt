this blog was made following Corey Schafer's tutorial for how to make a full-featured web app (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH)

this web app uses SQLite for Data Store and SQLAlchemy to work with data as python objects.
    * database is used for storing Posts and Users, their info and their password is hashed using flask bcrypt


To use this app, you would need to change the config files in /flaskblog/config.py to use your credentials
